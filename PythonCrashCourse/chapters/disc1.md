# Python Crash Course Examples

Welcome to my collection of Python examples. While most of the files here are original exercises and scripts that I created, some of the ideas may bear similarities to those found in the **"Python Crash Course"** by Eric Matthes, which I used as a learning resource.

## Overview

This repository showcases various Python scripts that I developed as part of my learning journey. Each file reflects my understanding and exploration of different Python programming concepts.

## Contents

### Chapter 3: Introducing Lists

- **File**: `ch 3.py`
- **Overview**: This file contains examples and exercises related to lists, including basic operations, list manipulations, and common list methods. The examples demonstrate how to work with lists in Python effectively.

### Chapter 4: Working with Lists

- **File**: `ch 4.py`
- **Overview**: This script builds on the list concepts from Chapter 3, introducing more advanced list operations, such as list comprehensions and slicing. It highlights various ways to work with lists in more complex scenarios.

### Chapter 5: If Statements

- **File**: `ch 5.py`
- **Overview**: This file covers conditional statements in Python, including `if`, `elif`, and `else`. The examples demonstrate how to make decisions in code based on different conditions.

### Chapter 6: Dictionaries

- **File**: `ch 6.py`
- **Overview**: This script explores Python dictionaries, showing how to store and manage key-value pairs. The examples include basic operations, nesting, and practical uses of dictionaries in programming.

## Purpose

The primary goal of this repository is to document my learning process and share the exercises and examples that Iâ€™ve developed. While some ideas are inspired by the "Python Crash Course" book, the majority of the content is original and serves as a demonstration of my growth as a Python programmer.
